This project is to build a CNN model to detect Cat and Dog using dataset from Kaggle
## Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle and split into the train, validate, and test sets.
Model using CNN with Conv2D, `MaxPooling2D`, and `Dense` architecture. The Optimizer that
been used is Adam
## Output
- Accuracy of training and testing are above 85%
- Model has been saved in SavedModel, TFJS, and TFLite format
## Instalation
Run this to install dependencies:
!pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib roboflow tensorflowjs
