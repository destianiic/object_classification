# Weed Detection CNN Model
## Decription
This project is to build CNN model to detect Weeds variants use dataset from Roboflow
## Dataset
Dataset can be downloaded from Roboflow with API that been splitted to train, validation and
test set
## Model
Model using CNN with Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, and `Dense` architectur. The Optimizer that
been used is Adam
## Output
- Accuration of training and testing are above 85%
- Model has been saved in SavedModel, TFJS, and TFLite format
## Instalation
Run this to install dependencies:
!pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib roboflow tensorflowjs
